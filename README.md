# Timeline Steering Simulation

This project explores a novel idea: can artificial agents "steer" probabilistic outcomes using a simulated internal model of belief and intention?

We simulate two agents playing games of chance:
- A **Random AI** with no memory or intention
- An **Intentional AI** that reinforces actions based on belief in success

## Included Files

- `timeline_steering_paper_fixed.tex`: LaTeX source for the academic paper
- `intentional_ai_simulations.py`: Python code for card draw simulation
- `README.md`: This file

## How to Use

1. Open the `.tex` file in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) to compile the paper.
2. Run the Python script using any interpreter to test the simulation.
3. Upload to GitHub for version control and timestamping.
